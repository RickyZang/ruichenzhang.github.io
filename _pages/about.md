Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/) (President's Chair Professor, FIEEE). Prior to this, I obtained my PhD degree at Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, under the guidance of Prof. [Ke Xiong](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Bt_z_14AAAAJ&hl=en) (The vice dean of the School of Computer and Information Technology) and Prof. [Yang Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EJj7uN0AAAAJ&hl=zh-en) in Sept. 2023.



My research primarily focuses on AI for networking, including **generative AI-enabled networking**, **large language models empowered networking**, and **reinforcement learning-enabled wireless communication networks**. If you are interested in my (our group) work, you may refer to this [repository](https://hongyangdu.github.io/GAINET/) for the latest updates of our group! Moreover, I am also doing some novel AI models to get meaningful information on plasma turbulence field. If you are also interested, please refer to this [repository](https://ntufusion.github.io/).


If you have any questions or have an interest in collaborating with me, please feel free to email me (ruichen.zhang@ntu.edu.sg)!
