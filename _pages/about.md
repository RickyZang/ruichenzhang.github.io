Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [College of Computing and Data Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/) (President's Chair Professor, FIEEE). Prior to this, I obtained my PhD degree at Beijing Jiaotong University in Sept. 2023, Beijing, China, under the guidance of Prof. [Ke Xiong](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Bt_z_14AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Yang Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EJj7uN0AAAAJ&hl=zh-en).


I am also honored to serve as a Managing Editor of the [IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnse) (IEEE TNSE), assisting the Editor-in-Chief and the entire editorial board in supporting the journal and the broader research community. My research primarily focuses on AI for networking, including **generative AI-enabled networking**, **large language models empowered networking**, and **reinforcement learning-enabled wireless communication networks**. If you are interested in my (our group) work, you may refer to this [repository](https://jyc5559.github.io/GAINET.github.io/) for the latest updates of our group! Moreover, I am also doing some novel AI models to get meaningful information on the plasma turbulence field. If you are also interested, please refer to this [repository](https://ntufusion.github.io/).


If you have any questions or are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to email me (ruichen.zhang@ntu.edu.sg)!
